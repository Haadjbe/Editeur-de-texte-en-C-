ABOUT THE CONCEPTION 
---------------------

- In this project, we decided to program two libraries in order to separate the LLC_Modele, from the others 
special functions programmed for the editor. 

-We have proposed a test text which is WIKIPEDIA.txt. 

- The "Captures" directory shows how the editor works, you can check for several of its functions.
